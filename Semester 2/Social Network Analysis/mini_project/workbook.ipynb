Its design philosophy emphasizes [code readability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_readability) with the use of [significant indentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-side_rule). Its [language constructs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_construct) and [object-oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small- and large-scale projects - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language))\n",
